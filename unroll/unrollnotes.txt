We can move through the square in 4 directions


Left to right (right)


right top corner to right bottom corner (down)


bottom right corner to bottom left (left )



botton left to top left (up)


if we set each square to false after adding to array, we can exclude them from iteration (which will be done inside
the scope of true valued array items. )
